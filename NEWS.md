# loon.tourr 0.1.3

`section` tour is implemented (not for compound widgets yet)

# loon.tourr 0.1.2

To accommodate the changes in the new version of `tourr` that, for `guided_tour()`, users have to define a tibble `record` in the `parent.frame()` environment, else error occurs.

# loon.tourr 0.1.1

The main change: the `**_tour()`, e.g. `grand_tour()` will return a `tour_path` function. In the new `tourr` version, the returned data structure by `tour_path` is changed. In the past, one can query the `interpolate` directly from the returned object. However, in the new version, the `interpolate` object is beneath `ingred`.
